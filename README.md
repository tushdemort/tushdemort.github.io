## About Me
Iâ€™m passionate about building **fair, efficient, and accessible AI systems**.  
With a dual background in Economics and Computer Science, I approach machine learning not only as a computational challenge but also as a real-world problem requiring inclusivity and performance efficiency.

## Publications
- **ViM-Disparity** â€“ *ICASSP 2025*: Bridging the gap of speed, accuracy, and memory for disparity map generation.


## Work
- **DeepTek.AI** - Worked on model quantization of ResNet and InceptionV3 models using PyTorch and Tensorflow for covid and pneumonia detection in chest X-rays.
- **WILP@BITS** - Worked on a new platform for professors to create, store and modify question banks. Added ability to generate custom question papers served to each student to prevent cheating. Used Python+Flask for backend, HTML/CSS/JS for frontend and Firebase for database.

## Research Projects
- **LLMs for multi-paradigm causal graphs** - Designed and deployed a dataset collection and annotation tool between humans and LLMs. Served local LLM pipelines as endpoints using transformers and Langchain. Used Python+Flask for website backend, Firebase to store chats history and context.
- **GeomCAD** â€“ Unconditional and Conditional CAD sequence generation using point cloud data with autoregressive decoding along with Diffusion models and Variational autoencoders.
- **Masked Autoencoders (MAE)** â€“ Adapting CAD generation models with multi-modal input like text and images.
- **LoRA** â€“ Finetuning and model merging on Mistral and Llama models.

## Projects
- **Floor Planner** - Created a floor planning and interior design software using Swing and Java.
- **Pharmacy Chain Management System** â€“ Developed PL/SQL procedures to manage data entry, enforce complex constraints, and generate reports such as prescription history and drug availability.
