# Hi, I’m Tushar Anand 👋

I’m a **Computer Science & Economics undergraduate at BITS Hyderabad** (CGPA **9.07/10**, Top **4%**) working at the intersection of **geometry, vision, and language**.

My primary interests are **3D representation learning, CAD modeling, multimodal generative systems, and efficient vision architectures**. I enjoy building **end-to-end ML systems**, from dataset creation and training pipelines to optimized inference.
